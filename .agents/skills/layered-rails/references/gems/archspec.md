# ArchSpec

Static architecture linter for Ruby and Rails — turns the layered architecture rules into executable checks that run in CI and on every (human- or agent-written) change. Reads source with Prism; no app boot.

## Division of Labor

ArchSpec complements this skill; it does not replace it. ArchSpec classifies code **by file path** and checks mechanical rules (dependency direction, forbidden calls, forbidden constants). This skill classifies code **by purpose** (a `*Calculator` under `app/services/` is a domain object) and makes judgment calls (specification test, waiting-room discipline, callback scoring, naming). Use the analyze and review workflows (see SKILL.md) to decide where code belongs; use ArchSpec to lock the boundaries in once files sit in the right folders.

## Installation

```ruby
# Gemfile
group :development, :test do
  gem "archspec"
end
```

```bash
bundle exec archspec init      # generates Archspec.rb
bundle exec archspec check     # run the checks (CI, hooks, after agent edits)
bundle exec archspec explain app/models/user.rb   # how a file is classified
```

## Reference Archspec.rb

The four architecture layers as an ordered `:layered` preset — earlier layers may use later ones, never the reverse (Rules 1–2), with cycle detection. Delete globs for folders your app doesn't have; empty patterns are harmless.

```ruby
# Archspec.rb
source "app/**/*.rb"

architecture :layered, layers: {
  presentation: %w[
    app/controllers/**/*.rb
    app/views/**/*.rb
    app/components/**/*.rb
    app/helpers/**/*.rb
    app/presenters/**/*.rb
    app/serializers/**/*.rb
    app/forms/**/*.rb
    app/filters/**/*.rb
    app/channels/**/*.rb
    app/mailboxes/**/*.rb
    app/jobs/**/*.rb
  ],
  application: %w[
    app/services/**/*.rb
    app/operations/**/*.rb
    app/policies/**/*.rb
    app/mailers/**/*.rb
    app/deliveries/**/*.rb
    app/notifiers/**/*.rb
    app/agents/**/*.rb
  ],
  domain: %w[
    app/models/**/*.rb
    app/queries/**/*.rb
    app/values/**/*.rb
    app/repositories/**/*.rb
    app/configs/**/*.rb
  ],
  infrastructure: %w[
    app/clients/**/*.rb
  ]
}

# Controller APIs stay in controllers — bare calls to the request context
# from lower layers are reverse dependencies (Rule 2)
application.cannot_call :render, :redirect_to, :params, :session, :cookies, :flash,
                        receiver: :none
domain.cannot_call :render, :redirect_to, :params, :session, :cookies, :flash,
                   receiver: :none

# Domain objects never read execution context — pass explicit parameters
domain.cannot_reference_constants "Current"

# A top-level app/<x>/ folder names a layer or a concept, never a vendor
component(:vendor_folders, in: "app/{sidekiq,temporal,redis,stripe,kafka}/**/*.rb")
  .must_be_empty(because: "vendor code goes one level deeper, e.g. app/clients/stripe/")
```

## What Each Block Enforces

| Config block | Skill rule / anti-pattern |
|---|---|
| `architecture :layered` ordering + `no_cycles` (built into the preset) | Rules 1, 2, and 4: unidirectional flow, no reverse dependencies, acyclic layers |
| `app/jobs/` in the presentation tier | Jobs are internal inbound entry points — they may call services and models; models may not call jobs (`SomeJob.perform_later` in a callback becomes a dependency violation) |
| `app/mailers/`, `app/deliveries/` in application | Mailers live above the domain layer — `OrderMailer.confirmation(...)` from a model callback is flagged |
| `application.cannot_call ... receiver: :none` | Request/params/render in services (layer-violations anti-pattern) |
| `domain.cannot_reference_constants "Current"` | Current in models (current-attributes topic) |
| `vendor_folders.must_be_empty` | Vendor-named top-level folders (service-layer audit naming rules) |

Skipping a layer (controller → model directly) is allowed by the preset — matching the architecture-sinkhole caveat: never add a pass-through object just to satisfy adjacency.

## Domain Services

The domain layer is more than Active Record models — it includes the **domain services** sub-layer: query objects, calculators, resolvers, repositories, collaborator objects. Their canonical home is *inside* the model namespace, so the `app/models/**/*.rb` glob already classifies them correctly with no extra patterns:

```
app/models/user/with_bookmarked_posts_query.rb   # User::WithBookmarkedPostsQuery — query object
app/models/order/total_calculator.rb             # Order::TotalCalculator — calculator
app/models/post/publisher.rb                     # Post::Publisher — collaborator object
```

To make the query-object convention itself checkable, add a suffix-scoped component on top of the layer map — and extend the allowlists it overlaps, because `can_only_use` checks every component a referenced constant belongs to (repeated `can_only_use` calls merge):

```ruby
component :query_objects, in: %w[app/models/**/*_query.rb app/queries/**/*.rb]
query_objects.must_implement_one_of :resolve, :call

# query_objects overlaps :domain — extend allowlists so references to them stay legal
domain.can_only_use :query_objects
application.can_only_use :query_objects
presentation.can_only_use :query_objects
```

The inverse case — suffix-named domain services stranded under `app/services/` (`*_query.rb`, `*_calculator.rb`, `*_resolver.rb`) — is the purpose-vs-folder mismatch: path-based classification calls them application, their nature is domain. The fix is to move them (the service-layer audit's demote recommendation); during the migration a guard keeps new ones from appearing:

```ruby
component(:misfiled_domain_services, in: %w[
  app/services/**/*_query.rb
  app/services/**/*_calculator.rb
  app/services/**/*_resolver.rb
]).must_be_empty(because: "pure derivation from domain data is a domain service — " \
                          "move it under app/models/<namespace>/ or app/queries/")
```

(As with vendor folders, expect companion `dependencies.allow` noise on files this matches until they move.)

## Tailoring the Config

- **Nested specializations.** `app/services/queries/` ≈ `app/queries/` — but don't carve it into `domain` with a more specific glob while `app/services/**/*.rb` stays in `application`: the files land in **both** layers, and since `can_only_use` checks every component a constant belongs to, models calling those queries get flagged (`domain may not depend on application`). Prefer renaming the folder to top-level `app/queries/`; keep a carve-out only when nothing in `domain` references it. Verify membership with `archspec explain`.
- **Models-first codebases.** With no `app/services/`, deep model namespaces carry orchestration; the layer map still works — but keep the `domain.cannot_call`/`cannot_reference_constants` rules, they're the teeth of the models-first caveat (no HTTP/LLM/job-enqueuing classes hiding under `app/models/`).
- **Accepted `Current` exceptions** (audit-column defaults, overridable kwarg defaults) get inline suppressions with the rule id from the failure output:

  ```ruby
  # archspec:disable-next-line constants.forbid -- audit default, accepted exception
  self.created_by_id ||= Current.user&.id
  ```
- **Mailer compromise.** Mailers using view helpers or presenters reference presentation constants — an upward edge from application. Prefer doing that work in the mailer's template (templates aren't analyzed), pass prepared values from the caller, or suppress with a reason.

## Adopting on an Existing Codebase

```ruby
# Archspec.rb — track existing violations, fail only on new ones
todo "archspec_todo.yml"
```

Entries are keyed by rule, path, and evidence, so they survive edits. Burn the file down as refactoring progresses (the layerification plan workflow's phases are natural checkpoints) and **never add entries to accommodate new code** — new violations are fixed in code, not hidden. When a check fails on agent-written changes, read the evidence first; `archspec explain` shows how the file was classified.

## Advanced: Per-Folder Components

For finer allowlists (e.g., policies may only see models, forms may not touch clients), skip the preset and declare one component per folder with explicit `can_only_use` lists plus `no_cycles among:`.

Two things to know first:

- **Overlap poisons allowlists.** `can_only_use` checks *every* component a referenced constant belongs to. Adding `component :services, in: "app/services/**/*.rb"` on top of the `:layered` preset makes every controller→service reference a violation (`:services` isn't in the preset's allowlist). Either stay overlap-free, or extend each affected allowlist (repeated `can_only_use` calls merge).
- **Keep models and queries in one component.** The `Model::SomeQuery` convention is bidirectional by design (scopes call queries; queries name their model), so separating them trips cycle/allowlist checks.

```ruby
component :controllers, in: "app/controllers/**/*.rb"
component :forms,       in: "app/forms/**/*.rb"
component :services,    in: "app/services/**/*.rb"
component :policies,    in: "app/policies/**/*.rb"
component :deliveries,  in: %w[app/deliveries/**/*.rb app/mailers/**/*.rb app/notifiers/**/*.rb]
component :domain,      in: %w[app/models/**/*.rb app/queries/**/*.rb app/values/**/*.rb]
component :clients,     in: "app/clients/**/*.rb"

controllers.can_only_use :forms, :services, :policies, :deliveries, :domain
forms.can_only_use :services, :domain
services.can_only_use :policies, :deliveries, :domain, :clients
policies.can_only_use :domain
deliveries.can_only_use :domain
domain.can_only_use :clients

services.must_implement :call   # only if a call convention is already established
no_cycles among: %i[controllers forms services policies deliveries domain clients]
```

Add `must_implement` protocol rules only where the service-layer audit workflow confirms the convention actually exists — a linter shouldn't invent one.

## What ArchSpec Cannot Check

Design judgments stay with code review and this skill's workflows:

- The specification test — whether responsibilities match the layer
- Waiting-room discipline — whether `app/services/` is shrinking into real abstractions
- Purpose-vs-folder classification — a domain calculator misfiled in `app/services/` passes every dependency check
- Callback scoring, anemic models, god objects, naming quality
- Architecture sinkholes — pass-through objects satisfy the linter perfectly

Run `archspec check` to guard the boundaries; run `/layered-rails:review` to judge what lives inside them.
